<h1><a id='intro'></a> Intro </h1>

Standard File is a sync and encryption library for web and native applications. It allows developers to focus on building great user-facing applications, and leaves the syncing, servers, and end-to-end encryption to our framework.

To build a quality application, most app developers today have to implement not only their own front-end clients, but also a backend architecture to handle model storage for their specific schema. With the growing trend of 'experimental' and 'single-use' applications, it becomes impractical to build a new server infrastructure for every application.

Standard File is a reusable client and server system that allows you to deploy a "dumb" backend server that doesn't know or care about your data schema, and allows you to encrypt data on the client-side and sync it with the remote server.

Standard File makes use of progressions in consumer device performance and capacity to enable end-to-end encryption on every platform. One can build any sort of secure and private application with a Standard File server, such as an [ encrypted notes app like Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org), or any sort of todo or personal data app.

# Protocol Specification

**Version 0.0.2**

_(For the 0.0.1 specification, see [here](https://github.com/standardfile/standardfile.github.io/blob/master/doc/spec-001.md))_

While most protocol specifications are hard to read and unnecessarily complex, Standard File aims to be a simple system that any developer can understand and implement.

<h2><a id='introduction'></a>Introduction</h2>

This document outlines the specifications for the client-server communications of the Standard File system. Any client can communicate with a Standard File server as long as it understands the server's requirements.

<h2><a id='models'></a>Models</h2>

The protocol consists of models on the server side and what are known as structures on the client side.

**Server Models**

*   User
*   Item

**Client Structures**

*   *Arbitrary*

An `Item` model has a `content` field. The `content` field stores a JSON encoded object that can be any thing the client needs to operate. In this client-server model, servers are to be treated as dumb and uninformed.

Relationships are handled by the client and not the server, which clients today have no problem handling. This allows for improvements to be made to the data model on the client level, and not on the difficult-to-change server level. It also allows for relationships to be encrypted.

<h1><a id='user'></a>User</h1>

A user model has the following properties:

| name | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| email | String | The email of the user. |
| password | String | The password for this user. _Note that passwords must be manipulated before being sent to the server._ |
| pw_cost | String | The number of iterations to use for the KDF. See Encryption for more. |
| pw_salt | String | Generated by the client during registration. See Encryption for more. |
| pw_auth | String | An authentication hash of the auth parameters (pw_cost, pw_salt).

<h1><a id='items'></a>Items</h1>

Item models have the following properties:

| name | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| uuid | String (or uuid for some databases) | The unique identifier for this model. |
| content | Text (Base64) | The JSON string encoded structure of the note, encrypted. |
| content_type | String | The type of the structure contained in the `content` field. |
| enc_item_key | String (Base64) | The locally encrypted encryption key for this item. |
| deleted | Bool | Whether the model has been deleted. |
| created_at | Date | The date this item was created. |
| updated_at | Date | The date this item was modified. |

## Client Structures

Client structures are stored in the `content` field of the `Item` model. A client structure can have any property the client chooses, as well as the following:

| name | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| references | Array | A metadata array of other `Item` uuids this model is related to and their respective `content_type`. See sample below.

`references` array sample:

```
[
  {uuid: xxxx, content_type: "Tag"},
  {uuid: xxxxx, content_type: "Tag"},
]
```


<h1><a id='api'></a>REST API</h1>

General:

1.  All requests after the initial authentication should be authenticated with a JWT with the `Authorization` header:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer _insert_JWT_here_

    ```

<h1><a id='api-auth'></a>Auth</h1>

Standard File uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

#### POST auth

**Registers a user and returns a JWT**

*Params: email, password, pw_cost, pw_salt, pw_auth*

*Note*: `password` needs to be processed locally before being sent to the server. See Encryption for more. Never send the user's inputted password to the server.

Responses

`200`

```
{"jwt" : "..."}
```

`5xx`

```
{"errors" : []}
```

#### PATCH auth
**Updates a user's password.**

*Params: email, password, password_confirmation, current_password*

Responses
`204`

```
No Content
```

5xx

```
{"errors" : []}
```

#### POST auth/sign_in
**Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.**

*Note*: Passwords needs to be processed locally before being sent to the server. See Encryption for more. Never send the user's inputted password to the server.

*Params: email, password*

Responses
200

```
{"token" : "..."}
```

5xx

```
{"errors" : []}
```

#### GET auth/params
**Returns the parameters used for password generation.**

*Params: email*

Responses
200

```
{"pw_cost" : "...", "pw_salt" : "...", "pw_auth" : "..."}
```

5xx

```
{"errors" : []}
```

<h1><a id='api-items'></a>Items</h1>


#### POST items/sync
**Saves local changes as well as retrieves remote changes.**

*Params:*

- `items`: An array of items
- `sync_token`: the sync token returned from the previous sync call. Leave empty if first sync.
- `limit`: (optional) the number of results to return. `cursor_token` is returned if more results are available.

Responses

200

```
{"retrieved_items" : [], "saved_items" : [], "unsaved_items" : [], "sync_token" : ""}
```

5xx

```
{"errors" : []}
```

### Sync Discussion

**Deletion:**

- Clients: set `deleted` equal to `true` and sync. When receiving an item that is `deleted`, remove it from the local database immediately.
- Servers: if syncing an item that is `deleted`, clear out its `content` and `enc_item_key` fields, set `deleted` to true, and save.

**Sync completion:**

Upon sync completion, the client should handle each response item as follows:

- `retrieved_items`: these items are new or have been modified since last sync and should be merged or created locally.
- `saved_items`: saved items are dirty items that were sent to the sync request. These items should not be merged in their entirety upon completion. Instead, only their metadata should be merged. For example, if at Point A the client syncs a Note item that a user is still typing, and at Point B the sync completes, the user could have typed more content in between A and B. Thus, if you merge all content, the user's progress in between A and B will be lost. However, if you merge just the metadata, then this issue does not occur.
- `unsaved_items`: returned if an error occurred saving those items. The only reason this should happen is in the improbable case of a UUID conflict.
- `sync_token`: this token should be saved when it is received and sent to subsequent sync requests. This token should also be persisted locally between app sessions. For first time sync, no token should be provided.
- `cursor_token`: returned if original request had a `limit`. Send this token back to the server to retrieve next page of results.

<h1><a id='import-export'></a>Import/Export</h1>

The export file is a JSON file of all the user's items, unencrypted.

**Format:**

```
{
  "items": [
    {
      "uuid": "3162fe3a-1b5b-4cf5-b88a-afcb9996b23a",
      "content_type": "Note",
      "content": {
        "references": [
          {
            "uuid": "901751a0-0b85-4636-93a3-682c4779b634",
            "content_type": "Tag"
          }
        ],
        "title": "...",
        "text": "..."
      },
      "created_at": "2016-12-16T17:37:50.000Z"
    },

    {

            "content_type": "Note"
          }
        ],
        "title": "essays"
      },
      "created_at": "2016-12-16T17:13:20.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

<h1><a id='encryption'></a>Encryption</h1>

Encryption and security should always be top of mind with Standard File.

It is important that there exist a separation of concerns between the server and the client. That is, the client should not trust the server, and vice versa.

Encryption keys are generated by stretching the user's input password using a [key derivation function.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function)

The resulting key is split in three â€” the first third is sent to the server as the user's password, the second third is saved locally as the user's master encryption key, and the last third is used as an authentication key. In this setup, the server is never able to compute the encryption key or the user's original password.

Note: client-server connections must be made securely through SSL/TLS.

#### Elaboration on User model encryption related fields

| name | details |
| --- | --- |
| pw_cost | The number of iterations to be used by the KDF. On native platforms, this should be around 60,000. However note that non-native clients (web clients not using WebCrypto) will not be able to handle any more than 3,000 iterations. |
| pw_salt | A salt for password derivation. This value is initially created by the client during registration. |
| pw_auth | The HMAC-256 of `pw_cost` and `pw_salt` joined by a `:` character. |

<h1><a id='key-generation'></a>Key Generation</h1>

### Client Instructions

Given a user inputted password `uip`, the client's job is to generate a password `pw` to send to the server, a master key `mk` that the user stores locally to encrypt/decrypt data, and an auth key `ak` for authenticating server params.

**Login Steps**

1.  Client makes GET request with user's email to `auth/params` to retrieve password salt, cost, and auth.
2.  Client computes `pw`, `mk`, and `ak`:

    ```
    key = pbkdf2(uip, pw_salt, sha512, 768, pw_cost) // hex encoded
    pw = key.substring(0, key.length/3)
    mk = key.substring(key.length/3, key.length/3)
    ak = key.substring(key.length/3 * 2, key.length/3)
    ```
3. Client computes `local_pw_auth` to make sure it matches with server `pw_auth`. If not, the server parameters are invalid and the client should abort authentication.

    ```
    local_pw_auth = HMAC-SHA256([pw_cost, pw_salt].join(":"), ak)
    if(local_pw_auth != pw_auth) {
      return;
    }
    ```

3.  Client sends `pw` to the server as the user's "regular" password and stores `mk` and `ak` locally. (`mk` and `ak` are never sent to the server).

**Registration Steps**

1.  Client chooses default for `pw_cost` (minimum 3000).
2.  Client generates `pw_salt`:

    ```
    nonce = random_string(128) // 128 bit random key
    pw_salt = SHA1:Hexdigest([email, nonce].join(":"))
    ```

3.  Client computes `pw`, `mk`, and `ak` using step (2) from Authentication Steps.

4. Client generates `pw_auth`:

    ```
    pw_auth = HMAC-SHA256([pw_cost, pw_salt].join(":"), ak)
    ```

5. Client registers with `email`, `pw`, `pw_cost`, `pw_salt`, and `pw_auth`.

<h1><a id='item-encryption'></a>Item Encryption</h1>

In general, when encrypting a string, one should use an IV so that two subsequent encryptions of the same content yield different results, and one should authenticate the data as to ascertain its authenticity and lack of tampering.

In Standard File, two strings are encrypted for every item:
- The item's `content`.
- The item's `enc_item_key`.

## Client-side

An item is encrypted using a random key generated for each item.

**Encryption:**

*Encryption version: 002.*

Note that when encrypting/decrypting data, keys should be converted to the proper format your platform function supports. It's best to convert keys to binary data before running through any encryption/hashing algorithm.

For every item:

1.  Generate a random 512 bit key `item_key` (in hex format).
2.  Split `item_key` in half; set item encryption key `item_ek = first_half` and item authentication key `item_ak = second_half`.
3.  Encrypt `content` using `item_ek` and `item_ak` following the instructions "Encrypting a string using the 002 scheme" below and send to server as `content`.
4.  Encrypt `item_key` using the global `mk` and global `ak` following the instructions "Encrypting a string using the 002 scheme" below and send to server as `enc_item_key`.

**Decryption:**

Check the first 3 characters of the `content` string. This will be the encryption version.

- If it is equal to "001", which is a legacy scheme, decrypt according to the 001 instructions found [here](https://github.com/standardfile/standardfile.github.io/blob/master/doc/spec-001.md).

- If it is equal to "002", which is the current scheme, decrypt as follows:

  1.  Decrypt `enc_item_key` using the global `mk` and global `ak` according to the "Decrypting a string using the 002 scheme" instructions below to get `item_key`.
  2.  Split `item_key` in half; set encryption key `item_ek = first_half` and authentication key `item_ak = second_half`.
  3.  Decrypt `content` using `item_ek` and `item_ak` according to the "Decrypting a string using the 002 scheme" instructions below.


### Encrypting a string using the 002 scheme:

Given a `string_to_encrypt`, an `encryption_key`, and an `auth_key`:

1.  Generate a random 128 bit string called IV.
1.  Encrypt `string_to_encrypt` using `AES-CBC-256:Base64`, `encryption_key`, and `IV`:

  ```
  ciphertext = AES-Encrypt(string_to_encrypt, encryption_key, IV)
  ```

1.  Generate `string_to_auth` by combining the encryption version (002), the IV, the item's UUID, and the ciphertext using the colon ":" character:

  ```
  string_to_auth = ["002", IV, uuid, ciphertext].join(":")
  ```

1.  Compute `auth_hash = HMAC-SHA256:Hex(string_to_auth, auth_key)`.
1.  Generate the final result by combining the five components into a `:` separated string:
  ```
  result = ["002", auth_hash, IV, uuid, ciphertext].join(":")
  ```

### Decrypting a string using the 002 scheme:

Given a `string_to_decrypt`, an `encryption_key`, and an `auth_key`:

1. Split the string into its constituent parts: `components = string_to_decrypt.split(":")`.
1. Assign local variables:

  ```
  version = components[0]
  auth_hash = components[1]
  IV = components[2]
  uuid = components[3]
  ciphertext = components[4]
  ```

1. Ensure that `uuid === item.uuid`. If not, abort decryption.
1. Generate `string_to_auth = [version, IV, uuid, ciphertext].join(":")`.
1. Compute `local_auth_hash = HMAC-SHA256(string_to_auth, auth_key)`. Compare `local_auth_hash` to `auth_hash`. If they are not the same, skip decrypting this item, as this indicates that the string has been tampered with.
1. Decrypt `ciphertext` to get final result: `result = AES-Decrypt(ciphertext, encryption_key, IV)`.

## Server-side

For every received item:

1.  (Optional but recommended) Encrypt `content` using server known key and store. Decrypt before sending back to client.
